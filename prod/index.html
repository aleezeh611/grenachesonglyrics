    <psongtitle>PLEASER - WALLOWS</psongtitle>
    <plyrics> 
        You're talking while you're fast asleep<br>
        As I walk slowly from your house<br>
        Back in your room remain the words I wanna say to you<br>
        But couldn't leave my mouth<br>
        Does it come as a surprise?<br>
        Language of averted eyes<br>
        Silence is what I do best<br>
        Still I hear it all<br>
        Wasting time around my head<br>
        So I talk to myself instead<br>
        Sitting out the weekend<br>
        Couldn't do it again<br>
        Say you want it right now<br>
        But I wouldn't know how<br>
        It's something that I can do<br>
        But how am I supposed to?<br>
        Quite the people pleaser<br>
        If only I could please her<br>
        In the sunset, feelings of enjoyment<br>
        Hold that thought, I think I need a moment<br>
        I'm aware there's something I should tell you<br>
        But my voice annoys me<br>
        Bite my tongue off with a smile<br>
        I can't feel it any more<br>
        'Cause recently the line is blurred<br>
        Between depression and bliss<br>
        Now I see that the times all change<br>
        They waste away<br>
        But I just want to sleep today<br>
        And I don't want to talk to you right now<br>
        You say but<br>
        I'm sitting out the weekend<br>
        Couldn't do it again<br>
        Say you want it right now<br>
        But I wouldn't know how<br>
        It's something that I can do<br>
        But how am I supposed to?<br>
        Quite the people pleaser<br>
        If only I could please her<br>
        I'm talking while you're next to me<br>
        Did I ruin the moment?<br>
        If I could tell you how I feel<br>
        Would you know what the words mean?<br>
        For sake of conversation<br>
        You should read the writings on my sleeve<br>
        'Cause that's the best you're gonna hear<br>
        So maybe I better leave<br>
